Scandiweb test

This is the github repo for my attempt at the Scandiweb junior full-stack dev position. The website is hosted on a Digital Ocean vm. There were some parts that felt off on my part while making the project, but they aren't anything major that couldn't be fixed on request, for example:

Should the text in the cart get shortened to fit in the cart boxes? Because in the figma file there are no such examples.

The text for the airpods is in german with different stylings, so should it be kept on the product page or no?

How does a QA test for a website work, does it need to have the cart pop up in a fixed position or not? Yes the cart looks broken when it gets opened when you aren't at the top of the site, but again, if it actually needs to be so, and maybe you need to be positioned at the top with a animation of some sort.

These are some of the examples I can recall while writing this, but again, I feel like these are minor things that could be easily fixable and communicated while making an actual project. That's about it from my part.

To launch this project, all you need to do is:

Clone the repo

```
git clone
```

Modify the script to have the ip you want to have it run on and run the launch script.

```
chmod +x script.txt 
sudo bash ./script.txt
```
Normally I'd use docker, but I wasn't sure how this project was supposed to be made, so I tried to keep it as bare-bones as possible.
